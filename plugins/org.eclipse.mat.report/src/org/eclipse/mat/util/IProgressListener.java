/**
 * This interface is closely modeled after
 * { link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor}. The latter has not been
 * used to avoid a dependency. It is implemented by objects that monitor the
 * progress of an activity; the methods in this interface are invoked by code
 * that performs the activity.
 * <p>
 * All activity is broken down into a linear sequence of tasks against which
 * progress is reported. When a task begins, a <code>beginTask(String, int)
 * </code> notification is reported,
 * followed by any number and mixture of progress reports (<code>worked()</code>
 * ) and subtask notifications (<code>subTask(String)</code>). When the task is
 * eventually completed, a <code>done()</code> notification is reported. After
 * the <code>done()</code> notification, the progress monitor cannot be reused;
 * i.e., <code>
 * beginTask(String, int)</code> cannot be called again after the call to
 * <code>done()</code>.
 * <p>
 * A request to cancel an operation can be signaled using the
 * <code>setCanceled</code> method. Operations taking a progress monitor are
 * expected to poll the monitor (using <code>isCanceled</code>) periodically and
 * abort at their earliest convenience. Operation can however choose to ignore
 * cancellation requests.
 * <p>
 * Since notification is synchronous with the activity itself, the listener
 * should provide a fast and robust implementation. If the handling of
 * notifications would involve blocking operations, or operations which might
 * throw uncaught exceptions, the notifications should be queued, and the actual
 * processing deferred (or perhaps delegated to a separate thread).

     * reasons to get rid of the various CanceledException throughout the code.
