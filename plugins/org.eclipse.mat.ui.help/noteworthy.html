		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Possibility to Select Size Units</h2>
			
			<p>
            There is a new option to display bytes in B, KB, MB, GB, or Smart formats.
            The default is to always display in Bytes format to match the previous MAT behavior and not cause any confusion.
            The option can be changed in the Eclipse preference dialog or using -Dbytes_display=(bytes|kilobytes|megabytes|gigabytes|smart).
            
			<br /><div class="imageleft"><img src="mimes/size_units_cfg.png" alt="Preferences dialog to configure size units" /></div><br />
			</p>

			<p>			
			In Smart mode, if the value is a gigabyte or more, display in gigabytes; similarly for megabytes and kilobytes; otherwise, display in bytes.
			<br /><div class="imageleft"><img src="mimes/size_units_sample.png" alt="A Histogram showing entries with different size units" /></div><br />
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">New API for Extracting Collection Details</h2>
			
			<p>
			The code which was used internally in Memory Analyzer to extract certain details about collections, for example size, fill ratio,
		    lists and maps entries, etc... is now exposed as an API.
		    This should make it easier to write extensions which need to inspect the contents or certain properties of collections.
			</p>

			<p>		    
		    Check the <strong>org.eclipse.mat.inspections.collectionextract</strong> package in the API Reference for more details.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">New and Noteworthy for Memory Analyzer 1.4</h2>
			
			<p>
				The New and Noteworthy document for version 1.4 is available 
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/1.4.0/noteworthy.html">here</a>.
