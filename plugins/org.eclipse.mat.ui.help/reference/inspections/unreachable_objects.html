	</p>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Motivation</h2>
			
			<p class="p">Sometimes a heap dump contains objects which would be removed at the next garbage collection.
			These are objects which are unreachable from the garbage collection roots.
			By default, Memory Analyzer removes these objects as part of the parse process as normally they are not
			important in determining a memory leak. If the heap dump is generated as a result of an <span class="keyword apiname">OutOfMemoryError</span>
			then the Java virtual machine will usually have performed a garbage collection operation to attempt to
			free space for the new object, so there will not be those objects in the heap dump file.
			There is a chance that the garbage collection was not performed, for example if the
			object to be allocated was so huge that it was obvious to the JVM that no amount of garbage collection
			could free enough space, or if the heap dump was triggered by another event.</p>

			<p class="p">Sometimes however, it is interesting to investigate these unreachable objects. For example if the application
			is spending a lot of time garbage collecting then it may be allocating and discarding more objects
			than is sensible. The types of the objects which could be discarded at the next garbage collection
			gives a clue as to which temporary objects the application is causing to be allocated.
			When acquiring a heap dump for this purpose using the Memory Analyzer,
			do not use the <span class="keyword cmdname">live=true</span> option as that would discard unreachable objects
			before the heap dump is generated.</p>

			<p class="p">Another reason for unreachable objects is if Memory Analyzer
			has been configured to discard objects on parsing to keep the 
			number of remaining objects small enough for Memory Analyzer to
			handle. See <a class="xref" href="../../tasks/configure_mat.html#task_configure_mat__discard">Enable discard (experimental)</a> for details.</p>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arguments</h2>
			
			<p class="p">None</p>

			<div class="p">Invoke using either:
			<ol class="ol">
			<li class="li">From the link on the Overview page
			</li>

			<li class="li">From the Query Browser via <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Java Basics</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol"> Unreachable Objects Histogram</span></span></li>
</ol>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_unreachable_objects__result"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Result</h2>
			
			The result is a histogram table showing the class names and number of object instances
			of the unreachable objects, together with their total sizes.
			This histogram has no object graph behind it (unreachable objects are removed during the parsing of the heap dump,
			only class names are stored). 
			Thus it is not possible to see e.g. a list of references for a particular unreachable object.

		</div>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Continued analysis</h2>
			
			<p class="p">If more information about the unreachable objects is required then the following steps
			can include the objects in the snapshot.</p>

			<ol class="ol">
			<li class="li">Close the snapshot
			</li>

			<li class="li">Select the heap dump using <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Window</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Heap Dump History</span></span>
			right-click, <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Delete Index Files</span></span>
			</li>

			<li class="li">Select 'Keep unreachable objects' using <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Window</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Preferences</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Memory Analyzer</span></span></li>

			<li class="li">Reopen the heap dump, which will reparse the heap dump.</li>

			<li class="li">Select the <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Java Basics</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">GC Roots</span></span>
			query.</li>

			<li class="li">Select the 'Unreachable Objects' row.</li>

			<li class="li">Run the 'Show Retained Set' query on that row.</li>

			</ol>

			This will show a histogram of all the objects which normally would be unreachable and would be garbage collected
			at the next opportunity. As these objects are now in the snapshot they then can be inspected in more detail.
