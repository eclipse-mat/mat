			<img class="image floatright" src="immediate_dominators_graph.png" alt="Object graph of an hash table structure."/>
			<p class="p">
				To find out why a single object is still in the heap is easy: follow
				the
				<a class="xref" href="path_to_gc_roots.html" title="Find out who is keeping alive a set of objects.">shortest path</a>
				to any GC root. But what if you have thousands of objects? Expanding
				every single path is too time consuming. Immediate dominators is a
				very effective way to find out who is keeping a set of objects
				alive.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				Let's consider the object graph on the left: The blue objects
				<img class="image" src="../../mimes/icons/obj_blue.png" alt="blue"/>
				represent
				<samp class="ph codeph">java.util.HashMap</samp>
				: the map itself, the backing array with the buckets and finally the
				map entries referring to keys and values. The yellow objects
				<img class="image" src="../../mimes/icons/obj_yellow.png" alt="yellow"/>
				are the values stored in the map, for example strings. The red
				object
				<img class="image" src="../../mimes/icons/obj_red.png" alt="red"/>
				is holding a reference to the map and thereby preventing its garbage
				collection.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				In this case, the
				<a class="xref" href="../../concepts/dominatortree.html">dominator tree</a>
				is identical to the object graph. Keep in mind that the tree
				structure can differ from the object graph!
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				The
				<strong class="ph b">immediate dominators</strong>
				of the yellow objects are the hash map entries. If all references to
				the entry objects were gone, all yellow strings were gone too.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				The
				<strong class="ph b">skip pattern</strong>
				tells the query to skip those immediate dominators which match the
				pattern. In the exemplary graph, it skips all blue hash map objects
				and spits out the red object. The resulting table says: this one red
				object keeps alive three yellow strings.
			</p>

			<p class="p">The sample below shows the immediate dominators of all strings
				in this particular heap dump.</p>

			<p class="p">
				<img class="image" src="immediate_dominators_table.png" alt="Table displaying the immediate dominators."/>
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				Read the selected row as follows:
				<strong class="ph b">7.669</strong>
				instances of
				<strong class="ph b">ConfigurationElement</strong>
				are responsible for
				<strong class="ph b">16.130</strong>
				strings. The configuration elements alone take up
				<strong class="ph b">368.112</strong>
				bytes (shallow size) while the strings use
				<strong class="ph b">387.120</strong>
				bytes.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				The
				<strong class="ph b">retained size</strong>
				of each object set is not calculated right away for performance
				reasons. Usually, the number of objects and shallow sizes should
				provide an indication what to analyze further. Of course, one can
				calculate the retained sizes using context menu.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				The
				<strong class="ph b">ROOT</strong>
				element contains all those objects, which are
				<strong class="ph b">not</strong>
				dominated by another object. Those are typically instances, which
				are kept alive through multiple paths which end in different
				<a class="xref" href="../../concepts/gcroots.html">GC Roots</a>
				. Semantically, the ROOT element is the virtual root node of the
				<a class="xref" href="../../concepts/dominatortree.html">dominator tree</a>
				.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				<img class="image" src="immediate_dominators_context.png" alt="Context menu available in the immediate dominator table."/>
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				As shown above, the
				<strong class="ph b">context menu</strong>
				gives access to both sets of objects: The dominators (e.g. the
				configuration elements) and the dominated objects (e.g. the
				strings).
			</p>

			<p class="p">In this example, the retained set of the 7.669 configuration
				elements would - among other objects - contain the 16.130 strings.
