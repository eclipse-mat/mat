			<p class="p">A tree showing each class which has been loaded multiple times.

			<p class="p">If a classes has been loaded multiple times then this might indicate
			a problem. Sometimes it is deliberate, where different class loaders
			are part of the application. Sometimes a class is replaced on the fly by
			the application or as part of a deploy/undeploy cycle in an application
			server and the old
			class loader and associated classes should be garbage collected.
			This can only happen once all the instances of classes, the classes themselves
			and the class loader are no longer accessible from the rest of the application
			or GC roots.</p>

			<p class="p">
			If there are no or few instances shown in a class loader line
			then that class loader might not be used anymore, but some spurious refence
			might be keeping the class loader alive or one of its defined classes or some of the instances alive, and so
			that class loader alive. The <a class="xref" href="path_to_gc_roots.html" title="Find out who is keeping alive a set of objects.">Path to GC Roots</a>
			query can help tell why a class loader is kept alive.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Java 8 and later virtual machines create some synthetic classes
			for lambda expressions. These can have names such as
			<span class="keyword cmdname">java.lang.invoke.LambdaForm$DMH</span>, <span class="keyword cmdname">java.lang.invoke.LambdaForm$MH</span> and
			<span class="keyword cmdname">java.lang.invoke.LambdaForm$BMH</span>. These classes are unusual
			in that multiple classes of the same name are loaded by the same class loader.
			Unless you think you have a particular problem with lambda expressions, either in 
			the code or the way the JVM handles them, then these classes can be ignored.</div>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The <span class="q">"Defined Classes"</span> and <span class="q">"No. of instances"</span> columns
			show figures for the entire class loader.</div>
