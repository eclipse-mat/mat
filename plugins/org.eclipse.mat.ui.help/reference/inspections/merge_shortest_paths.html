				the reasons it is kept alive.

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Explanation</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
				Unlike the
				<a class="xref" href="path_to_gc_roots.html" title="Find out who is keeping alive a single object.">Path to GC roots</a>
				query, this query
				can operate on multiple objects.
				However, it only
				finds the shortest path to GC roots; there may
				be other paths, but
				this query does not show them.
				As it operates on multiple objects
				there are multiple paths,
				and the query has the option to merge
				objects on a path by
				class.
				Seeing a common path can be useful in
				understanding why a
				set of objects is being kept alive.
