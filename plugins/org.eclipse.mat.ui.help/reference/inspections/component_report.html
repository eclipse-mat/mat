			<p class="p">A heap dump contains millions of objects. But which of those
				belong to your component? And what conclusions can you draw from
				them? This is where the Component Report can help.</p>

			<p class="p">
				Before starting, one has to decide what constitutes a component.
				Typically, a component is either a set of classes in a
				<strong class="ph b">common root package</strong>
				or a set of classes loaded by the same
				<strong class="ph b">class loader</strong>
				.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				Using this root set of objects, the component report calculates a
				customized retained set. This retained set includes all objects kept
				alive by the root set. Additionally, it assumes that all objects
				that have become
				<em class="ph i">finalizable</em>
				actually have been finalized and that also all soft references have
				been cleared.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__run"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Executing the Component Report</h2>
			
			<p class="p"> To run the report for a common root package, select the component
				report from the tool bar and provide a regular expression to match
				the package:</p>

			<img class="image" src="component_report_package.png" alt="Regular expression to match common root package to be used for the component report."/>
			<p class="p"> Alternatively, one can group the class histogram by class loader
				and then right-click the appropriate class loader and select the
				component report:</p>

			<img class="image" src="component_report_classloader.png" alt="Group histogram by class loader."/>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__overview"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
			
			<p class="p">The component report is rendered as HTML. It is stored in a ZIP
				file next to the heap dump file.</p>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__strings"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Duplicate Strings</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
				Duplicate Strings are a prime example for memory waste: multiple
				char arrays with identical content. To find the duplicates, the
				report
				<a class="xref" href="group_by_value.html" title="Group a set of objects by value.">groups</a>
				the char arrays by their value. It lists all char arrays with 10 or
				more instances with identical content.
				Java 9 introduced compact strings, using byte arrays to represent
				the string value. This section also includes those byte arrays which
				are dominated by a string.
			</p>

			<div class="p">
				The content of the char (or byte) arrays typically gives away ideas how to
				reduce the duplicates:
				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">
						Sometimes the duplicate strings are used as
						<strong class="ph b">keys or values in hash maps</strong>
						. For example, when reading heap dumps, MAT itself used to read
						the char constant denoting the type of an attribute into memory.
						It turned out that the heap was littered with many 'L's for
						references, 'B's for bytes, and 'Z's for booleans, etc. By
						replacing the
						<samp class="ph codeph">char</samp>
						with an
						<samp class="ph codeph">int</samp>
						, MAT could save some of the precious memory. Alternatively,
						Enumerations could do the same trick.
					</li>

					<li class="li">
						When reading
						<strong class="ph b">XML documents</strong>
						, fragments like
						<samp class="ph codeph">UTF-8</samp>
						, tag names or tag content remains in memory. Again, think about
						using Enumerations for the repetitive content.
					</li>

					<li class="li">
						Another option is
						<a class="xref" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#intern--" target="_blank">interning</a>
						the String. This adds the string to a pool of strings which is
						maintained privately by the class
						<samp class="ph codeph">String</samp>
						. For each unique string, the pool will keep on instance alive.
						However, if you are interning, make sure do it
						<strong class="ph b">responsibly</strong>
						: A big pool of strings will have maintenance costs and one cannot
						rely on interned strings being garbage collected.
					</li>

				</ul>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__emptycol"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Empty Collections</h2>
			
			<p class="p">Even if collections are empty, they usually consume memory
				through their internal object array. Imagine a tree structure where
				every node eagerly creates array lists to hold its children, but
				only a few nodes actually possess children.</p>

			<p class="p">
				One remedy is the lazy initialization of the collections: create the
				collection only when it is actually needed. To find out who is
				responsible for the empty collections, use the
				<a class="xref" href="immediate_dominators.html" title="Find out who is keeping alive a set of objects.">immediate
					dominators</a>
				command.
				See the <a class="xref" href="../../tasks/analyzingjavacollectionusage.html#task_analyzingjavacollectionusage__collectionsbysize">
					Collections Grouped by Size</a> query.

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__colfillratio"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Collection Fill Ratios</h2>
			
			<p class="p">Just like empty ones, collections with only a few elements
				also take up a lot of memory. Again, the backing array of the
				collection is the main culprit.
			</p>

			<p class="p">The examination of the fill ratios
				using a heap dump from a production system gives hints to what
				initial capacity to use.
				To find out who is
				responsible for the collections with only a few elements, use the

			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__emptyarray"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Zero-Length Arrays</h2>
			
			<p class="p">Even if arrays have a zero length they still consume memory.
			Arrays of length 1 might be replaced by a direct reference to the object,
			depending on whether that part of the code never refers to bigger arrays
			or whether some other code updates the contents of the array. 
				</p>

			<p class="p">
				One remedy is the lazy initialization of the arrays: create the
				array only when it is actually needed. 
				Another remedy is to use a singleton empty array.
				Consider if the objects need to be distinct
				(perhaps used as keys into a hash map) before making the change.
				To find out who is
				responsible for the zero-length arrays, use the
				<a class="xref" href="immediate_dominators.html" title="Find out who is keeping alive a set of objects.">immediate
					dominators</a>

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__arrayfillratio"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Array Fill Ratios</h2>
			
			<p class="p">Just like empty ones, arrays with only a few elements
				also take up a lot of memory. The examination of the fill ratios
				using a heap dump from a production system gives hints to what
				size of array to use. The remedy depends on whether other code
				refers to entries by index, in which case it might be possible
				just to reallocate an array up to the last occupied index,
				using for example <samp class="ph codeph">Arrays.copyOf()</samp>
				or whether the code just walks through the array, and the array
				could be replaced by a copy with just the non-null entries.</p>

				<p class="p">
				To find out who is
				responsible for the arrays with many empty entries, use the

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__primitiveArrayConstValue"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primitive Arrays with a Constant Value</h2>
			
				<div class="p">Sometimes an instance of primitive array:
					<ul class="ul">
						<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">boolean[]</samp></li>

						<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">byte[]</samp></li>

						<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">double[]</samp></li>

					</ul>

					has just a single value for all the entries.
					This could be wasted space, and indicate the array is not needed yet.
					If the entry is
					the default value for the type
					<samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">false</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">nul</samp>
					then perhaps the array has not been used yet.
					If the array is a fixed non-default value then perhaps the array could be

		<div class="section" id="ref_inspections_component_report__softref"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Soft Reference Statistics</h2>
			
			<div class="p">
				Soft references are cleared by the virtual machine in response to
				memory demand. Usually, soft references are used to implement
				caches: keep the objects around while there is sufficient memory,
				clear the objects if free memory becomes low.
				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">Usually objects are cached, because they are expensive
						to re-create. Across a whole application, soft referenced objects
						might carry very different costs. However, the virtual machine
						cannot know this and clears the objects on some least recently
						used algorithm. From the outside, this is very unpredictable and
						difficult to fine tune.</li>

					<li class="li">
						Furthermore, soft references can impose a
						<em class="ph i">stop-the-world</em>
						phase during garbage collection. Oversimplified, the GC marks the
						object graph behind the soft references while the virtual machine
						is stopped.

				</ul>

				The report shows:

					<li class="li"><span class="keyword wintitle">Comment</span>
					An example is the following:

77,745 objects totalling 20.8 MB are retained (kept alive) only via soft references.<br/>

						</samp></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li"><span class="keyword wintitle">Histogram of Soft References</span>
					These are the reference objects which are instances of a type or subclass of <samp class="ph codeph">java.lang.ref.SoftReference</samp></li>

					<li class="li"><span class="keyword wintitle">Histogram of Softly Referenced</span>
					These are the objects which the referent fields point to.</li>

					<li class="li"><span class="keyword wintitle">Only Softly Retained</span>
					These are all the objects retained the objects in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Only Softly Retained</span>

					if the VM was short of memory.</li>

					<li class="li"><span class="keyword wintitle">Referents strongly retained by soft reference</span>
					These could indicate a possible memory leak, as the referent field can

					<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Weak Reference Statistics</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
				Weak references are cleared by the virtual machine when the

				Usually, weak references are used to retain extra data associated

				or to maintain a canonical mapping as the canonical object can
				be retrieved if it is in use anywhere, but if no longer in use

			<div class="p">
				Objects which implement the
				<samp class="ph codeph">finalize</samp>
				method are included in the component report, because those objects
				can have serious implications for the memory of a Java Virtual
				Machine:
				<ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">
						Whenever an object with finalizer is created, a corresponding
						<samp class="ph codeph">java.lang.ref.Finalizer</samp>
						object is created. If the object is only reachable via its
						finalizer, it is placed in the queue of the finalizer thread and
						processed. Only then the next garbage collection will actually
						free the memory. Therefore it takes at least two garbage
						collections until the memory is freed.
					</li>

					<li class="li">When using Sun's current virtual machine implementation,
						the finalizer thread is a single thread processing the finalizer
						objects sequentially. One blocking finalizer queue therefore can
						easily keep alive big chunks of memory (all those other objects
						ready to be finalized).</li>

					<li class="li">
						Depending on the actual algorithm, finalizer may require a
						<em class="ph i">stop-the-world</em>
						pause during garbage collections. This, of course, can have
						serious implications for the responsiveness of the whole
						application.
					</li>

					<li class="li">Last not least, the time of execution of the finalizer is
						up to the VM and therefore unpredictable.</li>

			<p class="p">This sections analyzes the collision ratios of hash maps. Maps
				place the values in different buckets based on the hash code of the
