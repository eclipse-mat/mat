			<title>Security fixes</title>
			Eclipse Memory Analyzer 1.14.0 includes the security fixes first included in Eclipse Memory Analyzer 1.9.2.
			We recommend users of stand-alone Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.13.0 or earlier and
			highly recommend users of Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.9.1 or earlier to update to version 1.14.0 or subsequent versions.

								<dt>PROBLEMTYPE CWE-79</dt>
								<dd>Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')</dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
								<dd>Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.9.1 and earlier is subject to a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when generating an HTML report from a malicious heap dump. The user must chose to download, open the malicious heap dump and generate an HTML report for the problem to occur. The heap dump could be specially crafted, or could come from a crafted application or from an application processing malicious data. The vulnerability is present when a report is generated and opened from the Memory Analyzer graphical user interface, or when a report generated in batch mode is then opened in Memory Analyzer or by a web browser. The vulnerability could possibly allow code execution on the local system when the report is opened in Memory Analyzer.</dd>

							<dlentry>
								<dt>PROBLEMTYPE CWE-502</dt>
								<dd>Deserialization of Untrusted Data</dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
								<dd>Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.9.1 and earlier is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if an index file of a parsed heap dump is replaced by a malicious version and the heap dump is reopened in Memory Analyzer. The user must chose to reopen an already parsed heap dump with an untrusted index for the problem to occur. The problem can be averted if the index files from an untrusted source are deleted and the heap dump is opened and reparsed. Also some local configuration data is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if the local data were to be replaced with a malicious version. This can be averted if the local configuration data stored on the file system cannot be changed by an attacker. The vulnerability could possibly allow code execution on the local system.</dd>

							<dlentry>
								<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
								<dd>In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid HTTP/2 request,

								be possible to exploit this vulnerability.

								<dd>CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint</dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
								<dd>In all released versions of Eclipse Equinox, at least until version 4.21 (September 2021),
								installation can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack if using p2 repos that are HTTP; 
								that can then be exploited to serve incorrect p2 metadata and entirely alter the local installation, particularly by installing plug-ins that may then run malicious code
								</dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt>NOTES</dt>
								<dd>Eclipse Memory Analyzer uses Equinox p2 to access update sites.
								If in Eclipse Memory Analyzer the URL of the p2 update site is specified in p2 configuration as 
								HTTP rather than HTTPS then there is the possibility
								of interception or modification of traffic before the connection is upgraded to HTTPS.
								Stand-alone Eclipse Memory Analyzer 1.13.0 and later uses a version of Eclipse Equinox which gives a 
								warning such as:
									<lines>
									<systemoutput>
										org.eclipse.equinox.p2.repository
										Warning
										Thu Aug 25 16:52:34 BST 2022
										Using unsafe http transport to retrieve http://download.eclipse.org/mat/latest/update-site/content.xml.xz, see CVE-2021-41033. Consider using https instead.
									</systemoutput>
									</lines>
								Consult the <xref format="dita" href="reference/support.dita">Error Log</xref> to see these warnings.
								Eclipse Memory Analyzer 1.14.0 is configured to specify the supplied update sites
								using HTTPS rather than HTTP.
								It is then up to the user to specify HTTPS rather than HTTP in any new update site definition.

								<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
								<dd>Stand-alone Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.12.0 and earlier includes a copy of Jetty subject to CVE-2021-34429.
								For Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.37-9.4.42, 10.0.1-10.0.5 &amp; 11.0.1-11.0.5, URIs can be crafted using some encoded characters to access the content of the WEB-INF directory and/or bypass some security constraints. This is a variation of the vulnerability reported in CVE-2021-28164/GHSA-v7ff-8wcx-gmc5.
								Eclipse Memory Analyzer just uses Jetty as a web server to display help.
								If Eclipse Memory Analyzer is installed into an existing Eclipse installation it 
								uses the copy of Jetty in that installation.</dd>
