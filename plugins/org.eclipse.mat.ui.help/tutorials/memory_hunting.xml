         This cheat sheet provides some guidelines how the Memory Analyzer tool could be used 
			to find memory problems.

         1. Get a quick overview of the heap<br/>

			3. Search for groups of objects with big retained size - if there are no huge single objects, try to form different groups with as few as possible objects inside

         Open the dominator tree and look at the biggest objects. If there are some objects with too big retained size, do the following:
      </description>
      <subitem label="Select one of the suspicious objects in the Dominator Tree and expand it&apos;s subtree. Repeat this until you  have reached a significant drop in the retained sizes between the parent and the child nodes. This is the point    where the memory accumulation has happened." skip="true">

      <description>
         If the dominator tree does not contain any objects which have a
			very big retained size, then try to find groups of objects which occupy a lot of memory.
			<br/>Usually smaller groups are easier to further analyze.

         Here are several ideas of how to find interesting object groups
      </description>
      <subitem label="Open the dominator tree and group the objects by class. The sum of the retained sizes of the objects at the top-level of the dominator tree is equal to the total heap size. Therefore, there&apos;s a big chance to find an interesting group here." skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="Go to the Histogram view, and find the dominators of the biggest class(es) - use the &quot;Immediate dominators&quot; context menu, filter out the java* package." skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="Switch to classloaders view and calculate the retained size for the top ones - use the &quot;Calculate Retained Size&quot; context menu" skip="true">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="If there is an array class in the Histogram which occupies too much memory, then try to find groups of arrays with one and the same size. Execute &quot;Java Collections-->Arrays Grouped By Size&quot; context menu query." skip="true">
