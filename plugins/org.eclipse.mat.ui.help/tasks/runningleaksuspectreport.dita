			<p>As a result an HTML report will be opened. It contains an overview
				of the heap dump and leak suspect info.
			</p>
			<image href="../mimes/leaksuspects.png"
				alt="screen shot of leak suspects" placement="break"></image>
			<p>This report will be stored together with the heap dump and can be
				displayed when you open the heap dump again.
			</p>
			<p>Some of the sections in the leak suspects report have links to
				rerun the individual
				queries which make up the report. This can be
				useful for further analysis.
				See <xref href="../reference/tipsandtricks.dita#ref_tips/piechartlinks">Pie Chart Links</xref>
				for links from pie charts.
			</p>
			<image href="../mimes/leaksuspects1.png"

			<p>The standard leak suspects report operates just using the heap
				dump data,
				which is a snapshot from a particular moment. It does not
				use any time
				information as to when objects were allocated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The starting point is the
				<xref href="../concepts/dominatortree.dita">dominator tree</xref>
				.
				The biggest items at the top level of the dominator tree are
				analyzed,
				and if an item retains a significant
				amount of memory
				(default is 10%) then that item could be the cause of the
				memory leak
				because if it were no longer referenced then all that memory could
				be
				freed.
			</p>
			<p>It could be that single objects do not retain a significant amount
				of memory
				but many objects all of one type do. This is a second class
				of leak
				suspect.
				This type is found using the dominator tree, grouped
				by class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further analysis is then done on each leak suspect. For a single
				object
				leak suspect the retained objects are analyzed in the
				dominator tree to
				see if there is an
				<term>accumulation point</term>
				.

				An accumulation point is an object with a big difference between
				the
				retained size of itself and the largest
				retained size of a child
				object. These are places where the memory of many
				small objects is
				accumulated under one object.
				If the leak suspect is a thread then
				thread related information such
				as
				the call stack is shown, together
				with interesting stack frames which
				which have local variables
				referring to objects on the path to the
				accumulation point.
				If the
				leak suspect is a class loader then this is mentioned as being
				an
				interesting component of the application.
				If the leak suspect is a
				class then its class loader is mentioned as
				being
				an interesting
				component of the application.
			</p>
			<p>
				The
				<wintitle>Shortest Paths To the Accumulation Point</wintitle>
				shows a
				path from a garbage collection route to the accumulation
				point.
				There will be other paths, otherwise an object on the path
				would
				retain the leak suspect, so itself would be considered a
				leak
				suspect. If the root is a thread object then thread related
				information is also shown.
			</p>
			<p>
				The
				<wintitle>Accumulated Objects in Dominator Tree</wintitle>
				shows
				the dominator tree from the leak suspect to the accumulation
				point and
				also the objects that the accumulation point retains. This
				helps understand the context of the leak, and what is being
				accumulated.
				The
				<wintitle>Accumulated Objects by Class in Dominator Tree</wintitle>
				shows just
				the children in the dominator tree of the accumulation
				point, grouped
				by
				class. This is useful if there are many objects, as
				there will be fewer
				types.
				<wintitle>All Accumulated Objects by Class</wintitle>
				shows all the objects
				retained by the accumulation point, including
				the accumulation point,
				but grouped by class so it easier to see what
				is taking up the
				heap space.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the leak suspect is a group of objects then
				the biggest few
				objects are shown by
				<wintitle>Biggest Instances</wintitle>
				.
				If there are many objects and none uses more than 1% of the leak
				then this is omitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the leak suspect is a group of objects then the query
				attempts to
				find an
				<i>interesting</i>
				(not a standard Java class
				<codeph>java.</codeph>
				) object which indirectly refers to all of those
				objects. This is
				also called an
				<term>accumulation point</term>
				but is
				below the leak suspects in the dominator tree, rather than
				above
				the leak suspect object in the single object case.
				<wintitle>Common Path To the Accumulation Point</wintitle>
				shows a shortest path
				from a GC root to the accumulation point,
				giving a guide as to
				what in the application refers to the
				accumulation point.
				If the root of this path is a thread then some
				interesting thread
				related information is also extracted.
