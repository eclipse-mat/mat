			<p class="p">This report will be stored together with the heap dump and can be

			<p class="p">Some of the sections in the leak suspects report have links to rerun the individual
			queries which make up the report. This can be useful for further analysis.

			<p class="p">There is also a leak suspects report made by comparing two snapshots.
			This is available via <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Leak Identification</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Compare Snapshots Leak Report</span></span>
			or from the <span class="keyword wintitle">Overview</span> panel as <span class="keyword cmdname">Leak Suspects by Snapshot Comparison</span> which includes leak suspects and a system overview from comparing two snapshots.
			This works by comparing the dominator tree of the two snapshots, identifying
			big changes in the size of items in the dominator tree as possible leaks.
