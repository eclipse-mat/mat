				Well, analyzing big heap dumps can also require more heap space.
				Give it
				some more memory (possible by running on a 64-bit machine):
			</p>


			<samp class="ph codeph">MemoryAnalyzer.exe -vmargs -Xmx4g</samp>

			<p class="p">Alternatively, edit the MemoryAnalyzer.ini to
				contain:</p>

				For more details, check out the section
				<a class="xref" href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">Running Eclipse</a>
				in the Help Center. It also contains more details if you are running
				on Mac OS X.
			</p>


			<p class="p">If you are running the Memory Analyzer inside your Eclipse SDK,
				you need to edit the eclipse.ini file.</p>


			<div class="p">The memory intensive parts are the parsing of the dump and building
				of the dominator tree. Try parsing the heap
				dump from the command line, perhaps on a bigger machine. The dumps
				and index files can then be copied to a more convenient machine. 
				Once the dump has been parsed, it usually can
				be opened with less memory in the GUI.
				As a rough estimate if the number of objects is N and the number of 
				classes C, it might take at least T bytes to parse and build the dominator tree
				where:
				<p class="lines">T ≈ N * 28.25 + C * 1000 + P</p>

				P is the space used by the DTFJ or HPROF parsers. For a PHD file, the space could be:
				<p class="lines">P ≈ C * 1000</p>

				Memory Analyzer uses additional memory for caching index files, so
				performance will be better if there is more memory available than the minimum
				required to parse a dump.
				</div>

				<p class="p">Memory Analyzer has an architectural limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 3 objects,
				a current limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 9 = 2,147,483,639 objects, but has not been
				tested with that many objects. The current record is a heap dump file of 70Gbytes
				containing 1,160,000,000 objects, which was opened with Memory Analyzer running
				with a 64Gbyte heap. 
				Exceeding the limit can result in an exception such as
				<samp class="ph systemoutput">OutOfMemoryError: Requested length of new long[2,147,483,640] exceeds limit of 2,147,483,639</samp>.
				See <a class="xref" href="#task_configure_mat__discard">enable discard</a>

					Sometimes a heap dump is generated with more objects than Memory Analyzer
					can handle, either from lack of heap to run Memory Analyzer itself, or because the number
					exceeds the Memory Analyzer limit of 2,147,483,639 objects.
					This option controls some experimental settings to help analyze
					such huge dumps, by purposely discarding objects in the original
					heap dump.
					</p>

					<p class="p">The discarded objects are counted in the 
					<a class="xref" href="../reference/inspections/unreachable_objects.html" title="Find out more about objects that could or should be garbage collected.">
					unreachable objects histogram</a> together with any unreachable objects

					<div class="p">Some trial and error may be required to find suitable values of the options.
					<ol class="ol">
					<li class="li">If an OutOfMemoryError still occurs on a parse then more objects need to be
					discarded, either by increasing the discard percentage or by increasing the

					<li class="li">If the leak is
					not apparent from the snapshot with many discarded objects then examine
					the unreachable objects histogram to see if any key objects have been discarded
					and modify the discard pattern. Ideally only primitive arrays or objects which
					just have primitive fields or refer to primitive arrays should be discarded.
					This avoids disrupting the object graph too much.</li>

					<li class="li">If the types of the discarded objects look reasonable then try changing
					which objects have been discarded, either by varying the offset (if the

					<li class="li">If the available heap to run Memory Analyzer is very small then try
					discarding all of the ordinary objects by choosing <kbd class="ph userinput">100</kbd>
					for the discard percentage and <kbd class="ph userinput">.*</kbd> to match all

				<dt class="dt dlterm">Discard pattern</dt>

				<dd class="dd">
					Only objects with a class name matching this regular expression
					will be discarded. It is best to chose objects of a type which
					does not link to other objects, such as primitive arrays, or
					objects which just link to other such objects. This avoids breaking
					the object graph too much, and gives a hope that the leak
					analysis will find the problem.
					The default pattern of
					<kbd class="ph userinput">char\[\]|java\.lang\.String</kbd> discards
					character arrays and Strings. For Java 9 heap dumps with
					compact strings based on byte arrays then 
					<kbd class="ph userinput">byte\[\]|java\.lang\.String</kbd> may be 
					more appropriate.

				<dt class="dt dlterm">Discard offset</dt>

				<dd class="dd">
					A number between <kbd class="ph userinput">0</kbd> and <kbd class="ph userinput">99</kbd>.
					This allows different objects to be discarded from two different
					parses of the same heap dump. This might be useful to allow objects
					which have been discarded from one snapshot to be found in the
					others. For example with a discard percentage of <kbd class="ph userinput">25</kbd>, then offsets
					chosen from <kbd class="ph userinput">0</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">25</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">50</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">75</kbd> in successive parses will discard 
					4 distinct sets of objects.
					With a discard percentage of <kbd class="ph userinput">80</kbd>, and offsets of 
					<kbd class="ph userinput">0</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">20</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">40</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">60</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">80</kbd>
					in successive parses, will have each object present in one of 
					those five snapshots.

				<dt class="dt dlterm">Discard seed</dt>

				<dd class="dd">
					This controls the starting point of the random number generator
					used to decide whether to discard particular objects. If after 
					discarding objects the leak cannot be found then rerunning the
					parse with a different seed would discard some different objects
					and might show the leak better.
