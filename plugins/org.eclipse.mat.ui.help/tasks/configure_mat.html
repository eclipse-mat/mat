				Well, analyzing big heap dumps can also require more heap space.
				Give it
				some more memory (possible by running on a 64-bit machine):
			</p>


			<code class="ph codeph">MemoryAnalyzer.exe -vmargs -Xmx4g</code>

			<p class="p">Alternatively, edit the MemoryAnalyzer.ini to
				contain:</p>


			<div class="p">
				<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>-vmargs
-Xmx4g</code></pre>
			</div>


			<p class="p">
				For more details, check out the section
				<a class="xref" href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">Running Eclipse</a>
				in the Help Center. It also contains more details if you are running
				on Mac OS X.
			</p>


			<p class="p">If you are running the Memory Analyzer inside your Eclipse SDK,
				you need to edit the eclipse.ini file.</p>


			<p class="p">The memory intensive parts are the parsing of the dump and building
				of the dominator tree. Try parsing the heap
				dump from the command line, perhaps on a bigger machine. The dumps
				and index files can then be copied to a more convenient machine. 
				Once the dump has been parsed, it usually can
				be opened with less memory in the GUI.
				As a rough estimate if the number of objects is N and the number of 
				classes C, it might take at least T bytes to parse and build the dominator tree
				where:
				<code class="ph codeph">T ≈ N * 28.25 + C * 1000 + P</code>
				P is the space used by the DTFJ or HPROF parsers. For a PHD file, the space could be:
				<code class="ph codeph">P ≈ C * 1000</code>
				Memory Analyzer uses additional memory for caching index files, so
				performance will be better if there is more memory available than the minimum
				required to parse a dump.
				</p>

				<p class="p">Memory Analyzer has an architectural limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 3 objects,
				a current limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 9 = 2,147,483,639 objects, but has not been
				tested with that many objects. The current record is a heap dump file of 159Gbytes
				containing 2,041,300,061 objects, which was opened with Memory Analyzer running
				with a 172Gbyte heap.
				Exceeding the limit can result in an exception such as
				<samp class="ph systemoutput">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested length of new long[2,147,483,640] exceeds limit of 2,147,483,639</samp>.
				See <a class="xref" href="#task_configure_mat__discard">enable discard</a>

					Sometimes a heap dump is generated with more objects than Memory Analyzer
					can handle, either from lack of heap to run Memory Analyzer itself, or because the number
					exceeds the Memory Analyzer limit of 2,147,483,639 objects.
					This option controls some experimental settings to help analyze
					such huge dumps, by purposely discarding objects in the original
					heap dump.
					</p>

					<p class="p">The discarded objects are counted in the 
					<a class="xref" href="../reference/inspections/unreachable_objects.html" title="Find out more about objects that could or should be garbage collected.">

					discarded by Memory Analyzer after parsing but before building the dominator tree.
					</p>

					<p class="p">The discarded objects are not indexed, so are not part of the dominator tree
					nor are they counted as part of the retained size. As they are not indexed they
					will not appear in the <a class="xref" href="../reference/querymatrix.html#ref_querymatrix__list_objects">list objects</a>
					query.
					Most other queries will not operate on unindexed (discarded) objects.
					Sometimes it is possible to view them. The inspector view can display
					unindexed objects in the attributes and statics tabs.
					It is possible to 'Go Into' an unindexed object from the inspector view, and
					'Go Back' to the previous object.
					Unindexed objects do not have GC root information, so in that
					position in the inspector view is displayed a 
					<img class="image" src="../mimes/message_warning.png" alt="yellow warning triangle icon" />
					warning triangle
					and the message <samp class="ph msgph">Unindexed</samp>.
					Names resolvers can use the values of unindexed objects to find a displayable

					<a class="xref" href="../reference/tipsandtricks.html#ref_tips__value_tab">Inspector View value tab</a>.

					the unreachable objects histogram to see if any key objects have been discarded
					and modify the discard pattern. Ideally only primitive arrays or objects which
					just have primitive fields or refer to primitive arrays should be discarded.
					This avoids disrupting the object graph too much.</li>

					<li class="li">If the types of the discarded objects look reasonable then try changing

					chosen from <kbd class="ph userinput">0</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">25</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">50</kbd>,<kbd class="ph userinput">75</kbd> in successive parses will discard 
					4 distinct sets of objects.
					With a discard percentage of <kbd class="ph userinput">80</kbd>, and offsets of 
					<kbd class="ph userinput">0</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">20</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">40</kbd>,

			For older versions of Linux, you can use the nautilus command:
					<kbd class="ph userinput">nautilus "${selected_resource_parent_loc}"</kbd>
				</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm" id="task_configure_mat__text_encoding">
					<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">General</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Workspace</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Text file encoding</span></span>
				</dt>

				<dd class="dd">This configures the file encoding used for the following:
					<ul class="ul">
						<li class="li">Report HTML/CSV/Text file output</li>

						<li class="li">Export HTML/CSV/Text file output</li>

						<li class="li">
							<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Copy</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Save Value to File</span></span>
						</li>

						<li class="li">Queries reading settings from files:
							<ul class="ul">
								<li class="li">Customized Retained Set -xfile</li>

								<li class="li">Compare Tables and Trees</li>

								<li class="li">Find Leaks between Snapshots</li>

							</ul>

						</li>

					</ul>

					The initial setting is UTF-8, but this may be changed, for example to windows-1252.
					However, some characters in HTML reports might then not be properly displayed.
