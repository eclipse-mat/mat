		    <p><i>Get Heap Dump on an OutOfMemoryError</i></p>
			<p> One can get a HPROF binary heap dump on an OutOfMemoryError for Sun JVM
				(1.4.2_12 or higher and 1.5.0_07 or higher), HP-UX JVM (1.4.2_11 or
				higher) and SAP JVM (since 1.5.0) by setting the following JVM
				parameter:</p>
			<p>
				<codeblock>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</codeblock>
			</p>
			<p>The heap dump is written to the work directory.</p>
			
			<p><i>Interactively Trigger a Heap Dump</i></p>
			<p> To get heap dump on demand one can add the following parameter to the JVM
				and press CTRL + BREAK in the preferred moment:</p>
			<p>
				<codeblock>-XX:+HeapDumpOnCtrlBreak</codeblock>
			</p>
			<p><i>HPROF agent</i></p>
			<p>To use the HPROF agent to generate a dump on the end of execution, or on SIGQUIT signal use the following
			JVM parameter:</p>
			<p>
				<codeblock>-agentlib:hprof=heap=dump,format=b</codeblock>
			</p>
			<p> Alternatively, other tools can be used to acquire a heap dump:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<cmdname>jmap -dump:format=b,file=&lt;filename.hprof&gt; &lt;pid&gt;</cmdname>
				</li>
				<li>JConsole (see sample usage in <xref href="../gettingstarted/basictutorial.dita">Basic Tutorial</xref>)</li>

			Memory Analyzer can also read memory-related information from IBM system
			dumps and from Portable Heap Dump (PHD) files. For this purpose one just 
			has to install the IBM DTFJ feature into Memory Analyzer. 
			Follow the <xref format="html" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/dtfj.html">IBM DTFJ feature installation instructions</xref>. Once the DTFJ
			feature is successfully installed, then
				<menucascade>
					<uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
					<uicontrol>Open Heap Dump</uicontrol>
				</menucascade> 
			menu should also offer the following options for the file types: 

			<ul>
				<li>All known formats</li>
				<li>HPROF binary heap dumps</li>
				<li>IBM 1.4.2 SDFF</li>
				<li>IBM Javadumps</li>
				<li>IBM SDK for Java (J9) system dumps</li>
				<li>IBM SDK for Java Portable Heap Dumps</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			For a comparison of dump types, see <xref format="html" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-memoryanalyzer/#table1">Debugging from dumps</xref>. 
			System dumps are simply operating system core dumps; therefore, they are a superset of portable heap dumps.
			System dumps are far superior than PHDs, particularly for more accurate GC roots, thread-based analysis, and unlike PHDs, 
			system dumps contain memory contents like HPROFs.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Older versions of IBM Java (e.g. &lt; 5.0SR12, &lt; 6.0SR9) require running jextract on the operating system core dump
			which produced a zip file that contained the core dump, XML or SDFF file, and shared libraries. The IBM DTFJ feature
			still supports reading these jextracted zips; however, newer versions of IBM Java do not require jextract for use in
			MAT since DTFJ is able to directly read each supported operating system's core dump format. 
			Simply ensure that the operating system core dump file ends with the <b>.dmp</b> suffix for visibility in the MAT Open Heap Dump selection.
			It is also common to zip core dumps because they are so large and compress very well. If a core dump is compressed with <b>.zip</b>,
			the IBM DTFJ feature in MAT is able to decompress the ZIP file and read the core from inside (just like a jextracted zip).
			The only significant downsides to system dumps over PHDs is that they are much larger, they usually take longer to produce,
			they may be useless if they are manually taken in the middle of an exclusive event that manipulates the underlying Java heap
			such as a garbage collection, and they sometimes require operating system configuration (
			<xref format="html" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.1.0/com.ibm.java.lnx.71.doc/diag/problem_determination/linux_setup.html">Linux</xref>,
			<xref format="html" href="http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.1.0/com.ibm.java.aix.71.doc/diag/problem_determination/aix_setup_full_core.html">AIX</xref>) 
			to ensure non-truncation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			In recent versions of IBM Java (&gt; 6.0.1), by default, when an OutOfMemoryError is thrown, IBM Java produces a system dump, PHD,
			javacore, and Snap file on the first occurrence for that process (although often the core dump is suppressed by the default 0
			core ulimit on operating systems such as Linux). For the next three occurrences, it produces only a PHD, javacore, and Snap.
			If you only plan to use system dumps, and you've configured your operating system correctly as per the links above (particularly 
			core and file ulimits), then you may disable PHD generation with -Xdump:heap:none. For versions of IBM Java older than 6.0.1, 
			you may switch from PHDs to system dumps using
			<codeblock>-Xdump:system:events=systhrow,filter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError,request=exclusive+prepwalk -Xdump:heap:none</codeblock>
			</p>

			<p>
			In addition to an OutOfMemoryError, system dumps may be produced using operating system tools (e.g. gcore in gdb for Linux, 
			gencore for AIX, Task Manager for Windows, SVCDUMP for z/OS, etc.), using the

			Versions of IBM Java older than IBM JDK 1.4.2 SR12, 5.0 SR8a and 6.0 SR2 are known to produce inaccurate GC root information.

			****************************************************************** -->
			<p><b>Acquire Heap Dump from Memory Analyzer</b></p>
			<p>
			If the Java process from which the heap dump is to be acquired is on the 
			same machine as the Memory Analyzer, it is possible to acquire a heap dump
			directly from the Memory Analyzer. Dumps acquired this way are directly
			parsed and opened in tool.
			</p>
			
			<p>Acquiring the heap dump is a VM specific. Memory Analyzer comes with 
			several so called heap dump providers - for Sun based VMs (needs a Sun JDK
			with jmap) and for IBM VMs (needs an IBM JDK). Also extension points 
			are provided for adopters to plug-in their own heap dump providers.
			</p>

	<p>
		To trigger a heap dump from Memory Analyzer open the
		<menucascade>
			<uicontrol>File</uicontrol>
			<uicontrol>Acquire Heap Dump...</uicontrol>
		</menucascade>
		menu item.
	</p>

	<p>Depending on the concrete execution environment the pre-installed
		heap dump
		providers may work with their default settings and in this case a list of
		running Java processes should appear:
	</p>
	<image href="../mimes/acquire.png">
		<alt>Select a process to be dumped</alt>
	</image>
	<p>
		One can now from which process a heap dump should be acquired, provide
		a preferred
		location for the heap dump and press
		<uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol>
		to acquire the dump. Some of the heap
		dump providers may allow (or require) additional parameters (e.g. type of
		the heap dump) to be set. This can be done by using
		<menucascade>
			<uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>
		</menucascade>
		button to get to the
		<wintitle>Configuring Heap Dump Provider Arguments</wintitle>
		page of the wizard.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Configuring the Heap Dump Providers</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the process list is empty try to configure the available heap dump
		providers. To do this
		press
		<uicontrol>Configure...</uicontrol>
		, select a matching provider from the list and click on it.
		You can see
		then what are the required settings and specify them.
		<menucascade>
			<uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>
		</menucascade>
		will then apply any changed settings, and
		refresh the JVM list if any
		settings have been changed.
		<menucascade>
			<uicontrol>Prev</uicontrol>
		</menucascade>
		will return to the
		current JVM list without applying any changed
		settings. To then apply the
		changed settings
		reenter and exit the
		<wintitle>Configure Heap Dump Providers...</wintitle>
		page as follows:
		<menucascade>
			<uicontrol>Configure...</uicontrol>
			<uicontrol>Next</uicontrol>
		</menucascade>
	</p>
	<p>
		If a process is selected before pressing
		<uicontrol>Configure...</uicontrol>
		then the corresponding
		dump provider will be selected on entering the
		<wintitle>Configure Heap Dump Providers...</wintitle>
		page.

			<p><b>Multiple snapshots in one heap dump</b></p>
			<p>
			Occasionally heap dumps files can be generated which contain multiple heap dumps snapshots.
			If an HPROF dump is generated using 
			<codeblock>-agentlib:hprof=heap=dump,format=b</codeblock>
			then if a heap dump is triggered multiple times all the heap dumps will be written to one file.
			An IBM z/OS system dump can contain data from multiple address spaces and processes.
			It is therefore possible that the dump file contains heap dump snapshots from multiple Java runtimes.
			</p>
			<p>
			Memory Analyzer 1.2 and earlier handled this situation by choosing the first heap dump snapshot found unless another
			was selected via an environment variable or MAT DTFJ configuration option.
			</p>
			<p>
			Memory Analyzer 1.3 handles this situation by detecting the multiple dumps, then presenting a dialog
			for the user to select the required snapshot.
			</p>
			<image href="../mimes/multiple_snapshots.png">
			<alt>Choose a snapshot to be analyzed</alt>
			</image>
			<p>
			The index files generated have a component in the file name from the snapshot identifier, so the index
			files from each snapshot can be distinguished.
			This means that multiple snapshots from one heap dump file can be examined in Memory Analyzer
			simultaneously. 
			The heap dump history for the file remembers the last snapshot selected for that file, though when
			the snapshot is reopened via the history the index file is also shown in the history.
			To open another snapshot in the dump, close the first snapshot, then reopen the heap dump file using the File menu and
			another snapshot can be chosen to be parsed.
			The first snapshot can then be reopened using the index file in the history, and both snapshots can
			be viewed at once.
