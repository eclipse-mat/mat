				Memory Analyzer provides several queries to inspect the threads at the 
				moment the snapshot was taken.
			</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Overview</strong></p>

			<p class="p">
				To get an overview of all the threads in the heap dump use the
				<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Query Browser</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Thread Overview</span></span>
				query:
			</p>

			<img class="image" src="../mimes/threads_overview.png" alt="screen shot of thread overview"/>
			<p class="p">
				The query provide some properties like Name, Object, Context Classloader, etc...
				for each of the threads.
			</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Details</strong></p>
			
			<p class="p">
				You can proceed with the analysis of a single thread by using
				<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Java Basics</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Thread Details</span></span>
				context menu. Memory Analyzer provides an extension point, such that extensions can
				provide semantic information about the threads activity. The result of the Thread Details 
				query will contain such information (if available), some overview information, and 
				possibly the stacktrace of the thread.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				For DTFJ based dumps (IBM system dumps and IBM PHD files with associated java dump) the thread
				details view gives more information, including the thread state, priority and native stack trace.
				<img class="image" src="../mimes/thread_details.png" alt="Thread details from a DTFJ dump showing DTFJ Name, JNIEnv, Priority, State and Native id."/>
			</p>

			
			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Stacks</strong></p>
			
			<p class="p">
				Some heap dump formats (e.g. HPROF dumps from recent Java 6 VMs and IBM system dumps)
				contain information about the call stacks of threads, and the Java local objects per 
				stack frame. To access this information for all threads use the query
				<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Java Basics</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Thread Stacks</span></span>
				with no objects as parameter. To view the call stacks of particular selection of threads use
				the same query from the context menu. 
			</p>

			<img class="image" src="../mimes/thread_stack.png" alt="screen shot of thread stack"/>
			<p class="p">
				Exploring the call-stacks and the local Java objects is a powerful feature, giving a
				debugger like capabilities over a snapshot. It allows analyzing in details the reason
				for a memory intensive operations. And it also enables that heap dumps and Memory Analyzer
				are used not only for memory-related problems, but also for a wide range of other problems 
				e.g. unresponsive applications.
			</p>

			<div class="p">The DTFJ parser allows more control over viewing thread stacks. This is configured using the 
			DTFJ Parser preferences page. The options are as follows.
			<dl class="dl">
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Normal</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are only shown in the thread stacks view.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Only stack frames as pseudo-objects</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. The size of the stack frame is the
				size on the Java stack, not the heap.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Stack frames as pseudo-objects and running methods as pseudo-classes</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. 
				The stack frames are given a pseudo-type depending based on the method which is running in the frame.
				By viewing the number of instances of that pseudo-type it is easy to see which methods are running across
				all the threads and which methods use a lot of stack. This can help solve StackOverflowErrors.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Stack frames as pseudo-objects and all methods as pseudo-classes</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. 
				The stack frames are given a pseudo-type depending based on the method which is running in the frame.
				By viewing the number of instances of that pseudo-type it is easy to see which methods are running across
				all the threads and which methods use a lot of stack. This can help solve StackOverflowErrors.
				All other methods are also created as pseudo-class objects. The size of the method pseudo-class object is
				the size of the byte code and JITted code, which in other modes is accumulated into the size of the
				defining class. This makes it easy to find method which consume a lot of non-heap memory for byte code
				and JITted code.</dd>
