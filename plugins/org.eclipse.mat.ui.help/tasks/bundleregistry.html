			<p class="p">
			Eclipse uses an OSGi framework implementation called Equinox.
			An OSGi application is built out of multiple bundles.
			This query allows the bundles in a Eclipse program to be explored using a heap dump from that program. 
			</p>


			<p class="p">
				Bundles (or plugins) allow different parts of a system to be isolated. Each has its own class loader
				and interactions between bundles occurs using defined interfaces.
				See <a class="xref" href="https://help.eclipse.org/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fruntime_model_bundles.htm">Plug-ins and bundles</a>
				and <a class="xref" href="https://eclipse.dev/equinox/bundles/">Equinox Bundles</a>.
