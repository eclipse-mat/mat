			For a comparison of dump types, see <a class="xref" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-memoryanalyzer/#table1" target="_blank">Debugging from dumps</a>. 
			System dumps are simply operating system core dumps; therefore, they are a superset of portable heap dumps.
			System dumps are far superior than PHDs, particularly for more accurate GC roots, thread-based analysis, and unlike PHDs, 
			system dumps contain memory contents like HPROFs.
			</p>

			
			<p class="p">
			Older versions of IBM Java (e.g. &lt; 5.0SR12, &lt; 6.0SR9) require running jextract on the operating system core dump
			which produced a zip file that contained the core dump, XML or SDFF file, and shared libraries. The IBM DTFJ feature
			still supports reading these jextracted zips although IBM DTFJ feature version 1.12.29003.201808011034 and later cannot read IBM Java 1.4.2 SDFF files, so MAT cannot read them either.
			Dumps from newer versions of IBM Java do not require jextract for use in
			MAT since DTFJ is able to directly read each supported operating system's core dump format.
			Simply ensure that the operating system core dump file ends with the <strong class="ph b">.dmp</strong> suffix for visibility in the MAT Open Heap Dump selection.
			It is also common to zip core dumps because they are so large and compress very well. If a core dump is compressed with <strong class="ph b">.zip</strong>,
			the IBM DTFJ feature in MAT is able to decompress the ZIP file and read the core from inside (just like a jextracted zip).
			The only significant downsides to system dumps over PHDs is that they are much larger, they usually take longer to produce,
			they may be useless if they are manually taken in the middle of an exclusive event that manipulates the underlying Java heap
			such as a garbage collection, and they sometimes require operating system configuration (
			<a class="xref" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.80.doc/diag/problem_determination/linux_setup.html" target="_blank">Linux</a>,

			to ensure non-truncation.
			</p>

			
			<div class="p">
			In recent versions of IBM Java (&gt; 6.0.1), by default, when an OutOfMemoryError is thrown, IBM Java produces a system dump, PHD,
			javacore, and Snap file on the first occurrence for that process (although often the core dump is suppressed by the default 0
			core ulimit on operating systems such as Linux). For the next three occurrences, it produces only a PHD, javacore, and Snap.
			If you only plan to use system dumps, and you've configured your operating system correctly as per the links above (particularly 
			core and file ulimits), then you may disable PHD generation with -Xdump:heap:none. For versions of IBM Java older than 6.0.1, 
			you may switch from PHDs to system dumps using
			<pre class="pre codeblock">-Xdump:system:events=systhrow,filter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError,request=exclusive+prepwalk -Xdump:heap:none</pre>

			</div>


			<p class="p">
			In addition to an OutOfMemoryError, system dumps may be produced using operating system tools (e.g. gcore in gdb for Linux, 
			gencore for AIX, Task Manager for Windows, SVCDUMP for z/OS, etc.), using the

			<p class="p" id="task_acquiringheapdump__acquire"><strong class="ph b">Acquire Heap Dump from Memory Analyzer</strong></p>

			<p class="p">
			If the Java process from which the heap dump is to be acquired is on the 
			same machine as the Memory Analyzer, it is possible to acquire a heap dump
			directly from the Memory Analyzer. Dumps acquired this way are directly
			parsed and opened in the tool.
			</p>

			
			<p class="p">Acquiring the heap dump is VM specific. Memory Analyzer comes with 
			several so called heap dump providers - for Oracle and Sun based VMs 
			(needs a Oracle or Sun JDK
			with jmap) and for IBM VMs (needs an IBM JDK or JRE). 
			Also extension points 
			are provided for adopters to plug-in their own heap dump providers.
			</p>


	<p class="p">
		To trigger a heap dump from Memory Analyzer open the
		<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Acquire Heap Dump...</span></span>
		menu item.
	</p>


	<p class="p">Depending on the concrete execution environment the pre-installed
		heap dump
		providers may work with their default settings and in this case a list of
		running Java processes should appear:
		To make selection easier, 
        the order of the Java processes can be altered by clicking on the column titles

	</p>

	<img class="image" src="../mimes/acquire.png" alt="Select a process to be dumped"/>
	<p class="p">
		One can now select from which process a heap dump should be acquired, provide
		a preferred
		location for the heap dump and press
		<span class="ph uicontrol">Finish</span>
		to acquire the dump. Some of the heap
		dump providers may allow (or require) additional parameters (e.g. type of
		the heap dump) to be set. This can be done by using
