			<p class="p"> Finalizers are executed when the internal garbage collection
				cleans up the objects. Since you have no control over the finalizer
				execution, it is recommended not to use them. Because the memory can
				only be released when the finalize method finished, long running
				tasks in the finalizer can block the garbage collection. To get the
				finalizers overview select Finalizer Overview Query from the query
				list:</p>

			<img class="image" src="../mimes/finalizers.png" alt="Finalizer overview menu option and report" />
			<p class="p">This query includes the following subqueries:</p>

									query returns the currently processed object by the Finalizer
									Thread if any. The returned object can be processed for one of

									<li class="li">it is long running</li>

									<li class="li">the finalizer queue was or is still full.</li>

								</ul>

								<p class="p"> Use the finalizer queue query to check the queue.</p>

							</td>

							<td class="entry cellrowborder" style="vertical-align:top;">
								<p class="p"> This query shows the objects ready for finalization in their
									processing order. Following reasons can cause a full finalizer
									queue:</p>

								<ul class="ul">
									<li class="li"> The currently processed object is blocking or long running

								<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
								   On J9 JVM-based dumps (e.g. IBM Java, OpenJ9), as expected, this
								   list shows objects waiting to be finalized. On previous versions
								   of Memory Analyzer (1.10 and earlier) it also showed those
								   which have already been finalized and are waiting to be
								   garbage collected. Those objects where finalization has been
								   completed are not now shown by this query, but might be in
								   the unreachable objects histogram if they are waiting to be
								   reclaimed.
								   <p class="p">States</p>

								   <ol class="ol">
								   <li class="li">Initially objects with a finalize method start in the
								   <a class="xref" href="../concepts/gcroots.html">UNFINALIZED</a> state.
								   With a J9 heap dump this is visible as an inbound <code class="ph codeph">&lt;Unfinalized&gt;</code> reference from
								   the <code class="ph codeph">java.lang.Runtime</code> object.</li>

								   <li class="li">Once the object is no longer <a class="xref" href="../concepts/reachability.html">reachable</a>
								   it goes onto the finalizer queue, visible via this query and with
								   J9 heap dumps as a <a class="xref" href="../concepts/gcroots.html">FINALIZABLE GC root</a>.</li>

								   <li class="li">Once finalization is completed the object is not seen in either of these two
								   ways. Normally it would be garbage collected, but if the <code class="ph codeph">finalizer()</code>
								   code made the object reachable again by storing a reference to it in an ordinary object
								   it might still be strongly reachable.</li>
