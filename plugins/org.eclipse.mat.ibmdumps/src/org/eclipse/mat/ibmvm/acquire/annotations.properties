BaseProvider.defaultType.help = Choose SYSTEM for a full system dump, processed with jextract, \
with full object, class, field name data and full field and array values. \n\
Choose HEAP for a Portable Heap Dump, with object and class sizes and references, \
but without field names, or primitive field and array values.\n\
Choose JAVA for a Javadump, with only classes, class loaders and thread stacks \
but without object or class sizes or references, \
field names, or primitive field and array values.\n\
Choose HPROF for a full dump from Oracle-based VMs, \
with full object, class, field name data and full field and array values.
BaseProvider.defaultLive.help = Whether to dump live objects only. Selecting this may force a garbage collection on the target process before the dump.
BaseProvider.defaultCompress.help = Whether to compress the generated dump, to save disk space at the possible cost of a longer load time.
BaseProvider.listAttach.help = Whether to attach to every running VM to get more details when listing all VMs. This takes longer and may affect the VM.
BaseProvider.systemDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested system dump file name.
BaseProvider.systemDumpZipTemplate.help = A template for the suggested compressed system dump file name.
BaseProvider.heapDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested heap dump file name.
BaseProvider.heapDumpZipTemplate.help = A template for the suggested compressed heap dump file name.
BaseProvider.javaDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested Java dump file name.
BaseProvider.hprofDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested HPROF dump file name.
IBMExecDumpProvider.name = IBM dump (using helper VM)
IBMExecDumpProvider.help = This generates an dump from an IBM VM, using a helper IBM VM, Java 6 SR6 or later \
to list the IBM VMs and to attach to the target.\n\
Also works for generating dumps from Oracle-based VMs using a helper Oracle VM, Java 6 or later.
IBMExecDumpProvider.javaexecutable.help = Path to an IBM Java 6 SR6 or later java executable, to provide the Attach API \
to list and dump the target IBM VMs.\n\
Also can be a path to an Oracle Java 6 or later Java executable, to provide the Attach API \
to list and dump the Oracle-based target VMs.
IBMExecDumpProvider.vmoptions.help = Options to run the helper VM with.\n\
For Oracle-based VMs add '-Xbootpathpath/a:<JDK home>/lib/tools.jar', replacing <JDK home> with a path to the home directory of the JDK.
IBMDumpProvider.name = IBM dump (using Attach API)
IBMDumpProvider.help = This generates an dump from an IBM VM, using the Attach API \
supplied with the current IBM VM, Java 6 SR6 or later used to run Memory Analyzer \
to list the IBM VMs and to attach to the target.\n\
Also works when MAT is run with an Oracle VM, Java 6 or later, for generating dumps from Oracle-based VMs.
IBMVmInfo.name = Configuration for IBM dumps
IBMVmInfo.help = This generates a dump from an IBM VM using the Attach API.\n\
Also works when MAT is run with an Oracle VM, Java 6 or later, for generating dumps from Oracle-based VMs.
IBMVmInfo.type.help = Choose SYSTEM for a full system dump, processed with jextract, \
with full object, class, field name data and full field and array values. \n\
Choose HEAP for a Portable Heap Dump, with object and class sizes and references, \
but without field names, or primitive field and array values.\n\

with full object, class, field name data and full field and array values.
IBMVmInfo.live.help = Whether to dump live objects only. Selecting this may force a garbage collection on the target process before the dump.
IBMVmInfo.compress.help = Whether to compress the generated dump, to save disk space at the possible cost of a longer load time.
IBMVmInfo.dumpdir.help = Alternative location used to find where the target VM generates dump files. \
If not specified then the system property 'user.dir' on the target VM is used to find the dump files. This option \
can be useful when VM options have been used to select an alternative dump location or \
on the Windows 7 operating system when writes to the program directory %ProgramFiles(x86)% \
have been redirected to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\VirtualStore or %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore.
IBMExecVmInfo.name = Configuration for IBM dumps using a helper VM
IBMExecVmInfo.help = This generates a dump from an IBM VM, using a helper IBM VM, Java 6 SR6 or later \
to attach to the target IBM VM.\n\
Also works with a helper Oracle VM, Java 6 or later, for generating dumps from Oracle-based VMs.
IBMExecVmInfo.javaexecutable.help = Path to an IBM Java 6 SR6 or later java executable, \
to provide the Attach API to attach to the target IBM VM.\n\
Also can be a path to an Oracle Java 6 or later Java executable, to provide the Attach API \ 
to list and dump the Oracle-based target VMs.
IBMExecVmInfo.vmoptions.help = Options to run the helper VM with.\n\
For Oracle-based VMs add '-Xbootpathpath/a:<JDK home>/lib/tools.jar', replacing <JDK home> with a path to the home directory of the JDK.
