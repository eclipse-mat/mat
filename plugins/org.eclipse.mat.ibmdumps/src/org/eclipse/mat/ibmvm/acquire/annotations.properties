BaseProvider.defaultType.help = Choose SYSTEM for a full system dump, processed with jextract, \
with full object, class, field name data and full field and array values. \n\
Choose HEAP for a Portable Heap Dump, with object and class sizes and references, \
but without field names, or primitive field and array values.\n\
Choose JAVA for a Javadump, with only classes, class loaders and thread stacks \
but without object and class sizes and references, \
field names, or primitive field and array values.
BaseProvider.defaultCompress.help = Whether to compress the generated dump, to save disk space at the possible cost of a longer load time.
BaseProvider.listAttach.help = Whether to attach to every running VM to get more details when listing all VMs. This takes longer and may affect the VM.
BaseProvider.systemDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested system dump file name.
BaseProvider.systemDumpZipTemplate.help = A template for the suggested compressed system dump file name.
BaseProvider.heapDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested heap dump file name.
BaseProvider.heapDumpZipTemplate.help = A template for the suggested compressed heap dump file name.
BaseProvider.javaDumpTemplate.help = A template for the suggested java dump file name.
IBMExecDumpProvider.name = IBM dump (using helper VM)
IBMExecDumpProvider.help = This generates an dump from an IBM VM, using a helper IBM VM, Java 6 SR6 or later \
to list the IBM VMs and to attach to the target.
IBMExecDumpProvider.javaexecutable.help = Path to an IBM Java 6 SR6 or later java executable, to provide the Attach API \
to list the target IBM VMs.
IBMExecDumpProvider.vmoptions.help = Options to run the helper VM with.
IBMDumpProvider.name = IBM dump (using Attach API)
IBMDumpProvider.help = This generates an dump from an IBM VM, using the Attach API \
supplied with the current IBM VM, Java 6 SR6 or later used to run Memory Analyzer \
to list the IBM VMs and to attach to the target.
IBMVmInfo.name = Configuration for IBM dumps
IBMVmInfo.help = This generates a dump from an IBM VM.

IBMVmInfo.compress.help = Whether to compress the generated dump, to save disk space at the possible cost of a longer load time.
IBMVmInfo.dumpdir.help = Alternative location used to find where the target VM generates dump files. \
If not specified then the system property 'user.dir' on the target VM is used to find the dump files. This option \
can be useful on the Windows 7 operating system when writes to the program directory %ProgramFiles(x86)% \
have been redirected to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\VirtualStore or %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore.
IBMExecVmInfo.name = Configuration for IBM dumps using a helper VM
