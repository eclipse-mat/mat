/**
 * Interface for snapshots. It is the central API for handling HPROF snapshots.
 * <p>
 * A snapshot basically has an {@link SnapshotInfo} object describing it and
 * various methods operating on it. Be aware that such a snapshot potentially
 * holds quite a lot of memory, so try to keep not too many open at the same
 * time.
 * <p>
 * The basic "handle" you will encounter in the API is an <code>int</code>. It
 * is the id of an object and is always of the size of four bytes (no matter if
 * 32 or 64 bit). Operations are either performed on <code>int</code> or
 * <code>int[]</code> (addresses are stored in longs, but they should be used
 * only for display purposes). In order to simplify working with them and for
 * performance reasons compared to <code>Collection&lt;Integer&gt;</code> some
 * helper classes are provided and you are strongly advised to use them:
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.BitField} (for huge fixed bit fields), 
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayIntBig} and 
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayLongBig} (for huge growing arrays),
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayIntCompressed} and
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayLongCompressed} (for fixed-size compressed arrays),
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayInt} and 
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.ArrayLong} for large lists of ints or longs,
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.SetInt} and 
 * {@link org.eclipse.mat.collect.SetLong} for large sets of ints or longs.
