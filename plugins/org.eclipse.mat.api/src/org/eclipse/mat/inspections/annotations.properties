BigDropsQuery.name = Big Drops in Dominator Tree
BigDropsQuery.category = Leak Identification
BigDropsQuery.help = Display memory accumulation points in the dominator tree.\n\n\
Displayed are objects where the difference in the retained size of the parent \
and the children is very big. These are places where the memory of many small \
objects is accumulated under one object. The first \"interesting\" dominator \
of the accumulation point is also shown.
BigDropsQuery.pattern.help = Specifies which dominators of the big drop object (accumulation point) should be skipped

ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.name = Class Loader Explorer
ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.category = Java Basics
ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.help = Lists all or selected class loaders including their defined classes. \
Drill-down to show the parent class loader or with -tree the child class loaders.
ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.objects.help = The class loaders to display. The objects are either class loaders, \
or classes for which their class loaders will be used, or objects for which the class loader of their types will be used. \
By default all the class loaders are chosen, or if -tree is specified then all the class loaders without parents are chosen.
ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.tree.help = Display the class loaders as a parent/child tree rather than expanding to show the parent.

DuplicatedClassesQuery.name = Duplicate Classes
DuplicatedClassesQuery.category = Java Basics
DuplicatedClassesQuery.help = Extract classes loaded multiple times.

ClassReferrersQuery.name = Show objects by class
ClassReferrersQuery.menu.0.category = 2|Show objects by class
ClassReferrersQuery.menu.0.label = 1|by outgoing references
ClassReferrersQuery.menu.1.category = 2|Show objects by class
ClassReferrersQuery.menu.1.label = 2|by incoming references
ClassReferrersQuery.help = List the selected objects, grouped by class. \
A class group can be expanded as a tree to show references to or from other objects, also grouped by class. \
When a class group is expanded, find all the objects that any object in the group points to \
and then group those objects by class.
ClassReferrersQuery.objects.help = The objects to display with references.
ClassReferrersQuery.inbound.help = When a class group is expanded find all the objects pointing to any object in the group \
and then group those objects by class.

CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.name = Customized Retained Set
CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.category = Java Basics
CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.help = Calculate the retained set of objects excluding references via given fields.\n\n\
The custom retained set comprises all objects included in the normal retained set. \
Additionally, it adds objects which are (a) reachable from the root set and (b) \
would be garbage collected if the references defined by the excludes would not exist.\n\n\
\
In terms of set operations, one could put it this way: the customized retained set contains \
all objects which are unreachable if all references to the root set and all references \
defined by the excludes are removed. From the resulting set, the objects of the retained set \
derived only through the excludes are removed.\n\n\
\
For example, to calculate the retained set of all classes in a package including those \
objects that would be freed only after the finalizer run (only on Sun's VM!), one could say:\n\
\tcustomized_retained_set sample\\.package.* -x java.lang.ref.Finalizer:referent\n\n\
\
The excludes are specified as follows:\n\
\texclude ::= ( <objectAddress> | <className> ) [: <field> [, <field> ]]\n\
Example:\n\
\tjava.lang.ref.WeakReference:referent\n\
\t0x4711:attrib1,attrib2\n\n\
\
Use the argument 'xfile' to read excludes from the file. Each lines must have the same format.

CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.excludedReferences.help = Exclude definitions
CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.excludedReferencesListFile.help = File containing exclude definitions

GroupByValueQuery.name = Group By Value
GroupByValueQuery.category = Java Basics
GroupByValueQuery.help = Group objects by their string representation.\n\n\
By default, the objects are grouped by the the class specific name resolver. \
Alternatively, one can specify a field using the dot notation, whose name \
resolver is then used.\n\n\
Examples:\n\
To find duplicate strings, run:\n\tgroup_by_value java.lang.String\n\
To group array lists by their size, run:\n\tgroup_by_value java.util.ArrayList -field size
GroupByValueQuery.field.help = An optional dot notation to specify a field which is used to group the objects, \
e.g. modCount to group HashMaps by their modifications.

HistogramQuery.groupBy.help = Whether to group the objects in the resulting histogram by class, superclass, classloader or by package.

ImmediateDominatorsQuery.name = Immediate Dominators 
ImmediateDominatorsQuery.help = Find and aggregate on class level all objects dominating a given set of objects.\n\n\
The immediate dominators of all char arrays (immediate_dominators char[]) \
are all objects responsible for keeping the char[] alive. The result will \
contain most likely java.lang.String objects. Now add the skip pattern java.*, \
and you will see the non-JDK classes responsible for the char arrays.
ImmediateDominatorsQuery.skipPattern.help = A regular expression specifying which dominators to skip while going up the dominator tree. \
If the dominator of an object matches the pattern, then the dominator of the \
dominator will be taken, and so on, until an object not matching the skip pattern \
is reached.
ImmediateDominatorsQuery.objects.help = Set of objects to include in the analysis.

LeakHunterQuery.name = Find Leaks
LeakHunterQuery.category = Leak Identification
LeakHunterQuery.help = Report potential memory leaks.\n\n\
The query analyzes the dominator tree and searches for big memory chunks \
(by default more than 10% of the total heap). These could be single objects \
or groups of objects from the same class. Then it tries to automatically find the exact \
accumulation point - usually an array or a collection.
LeakHunterQuery.skipPattern.help = A regular expression specifying which dominators/referers to skip when a problematic object is described.
LeakHunterQuery.threshold_percent.help = Big memory chunk size in percent of the heap. (Default value is 10%.)

ObjectListQuery.inbound.help = When an object is expanded show all the objects pointing to this object, rather than \
all the objects that this object points to.
