or classes for which their class loaders will be used, or objects for which the class loader of their types will be used. \
By default all the class loaders are chosen, or if -tree is specified then all the class loaders without parents are chosen.
ClassLoaderExplorerQuery.tree.help = Display the class loaders as a parent/child tree rather than expanding to show the parent.

ClassReferrersQuery.name = Show objects by class

CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.category = Java Basics
CustomizedRetainedSetQuery.help = Calculate the retained set of objects excluding references via given fields.\n\n\
The custom retained set comprises all objects included in the normal retained set. \
Additionally, it adds objects which are (a) reachable from the root set and (b) \
would be garbage collected if the references defined by the excludes would not exist.\n\n\
\
In terms of set operations, one could put it this way: the customized retained set contains \
all objects which are unreachable if all references to the root set and all references \
defined by the excludes are removed. From the resulting set, the objects of the retained set \
derived only through the excludes are removed.\n\n\
\
For example, to calculate the retained set of all classes in a package including those \
objects that would be freed only after the finalizer run (only on Sun's VM!), one could say:\n\
\tcustomized_retained_set sample\\.package.* -x java.lang.ref.Finalizer:referent\n\n\
\
The excludes are specified as follows:\n\
\texclude ::= ( <objectAddress> | <className> ) [: <field> [, <field> ]]\n\
Example:\n\
\tjava.lang.ref.WeakReference:referent\n\
\t0x4711:attrib1,attrib2\n\n\
\
Use the argument 'xfile' to read excludes from the file. Each lines must have the same format.

contain most likely java.lang.String objects. Now add the skip pattern java.*, \
and you will see the non-JDK classes responsible for the char arrays.
ImmediateDominatorsQuery.skipPattern.help = A regular expression specifying which dominators to skip while going up the dominator tree. \
