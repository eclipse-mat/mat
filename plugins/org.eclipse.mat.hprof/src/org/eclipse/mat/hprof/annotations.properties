ExportHprof.name = Export Snapshot
ExportHprof.help = Exports the current snapshot as a new HPROF file.\n\
This query can be used to convert a DTFJ core dump to HPROF format, or to redact sensitive data, or to \
obfuscate class and method names in a dump. The mapping from the original names to the new obfuscated names \
can be stored in the remap file. If several related snapshots are to be exported then the same remap file \
can be used for all, so that the exported HPROF files use the same obfuscated names for the same class in each file.
ExportHprof.output.help = The file name to be written to.
ExportHprof.redact.help = Whether to redact certain field and array types. \n\
NONE exports all field and array values unchanged.\n\
BASIC zeroes byte and char fields and arrays, and zeroes int arrays.\n\
FULL zeroes all field and array values.\n\
It is up to the user to determine whether these options are sufficient to remove all of the sensitive \
data.
ExportHprof.skipPattern.help = A regular expression specifying which class names not \
to obfuscate. It is important to at least list 'java.lang.*' to avoid problems when parsing the new \
HPROF file with Memory Analyzer. Use '.*' to disable obfuscation.
ExportHprof.avoidPattern.help = A regular expression matching names which should not be generated \
by obfuscation.
ExportHprof.remapFile.help = A output file in properties file format generated with mappings from old class names to new obfuscated names. \
If present it is also read at the start to use existing mappings from previous exports of HPROF dumps. \ 
It is then updated at the end with any new mappings.
ExportHprof.undo.help = Whether to reverse the obfuscation process using the supplied \
remap file.
ExportHprof.objects.help = Only export selected objects. See the help for how this
could be used to remove unreachable objects retained by the 'keep unreachable objects' option.
