ExportHprof.name = Export Snapshot
ExportHprof.help = Exports the current snapshot as a new HPROF file.\n\
This query can be used to convert a DTFJ core dump to HPROF format, or to redact sensitive data, or to \
obfuscate class and method names in a dump. The mapping from the original names to the new obfuscated names \
is stored in the mapping file. If several related snapshots are to be exported then the same mapping file \
can be used for all, so that the exported HPROF files use the same obfuscated names for the same class in each file.
ExportHprof.output.help = The file name of the new HPROF dump.
ExportHprof.redact.help = Whether to redact certain field and array types.\n\
NONE exports all field and array values unchanged.\n\
NAMES obfuscates byte and char array contents to match obfuscated class and field names.\n\
BASIC zeroes byte and char fields and arrays, and zeroes int arrays.\n\
FULL zeroes all field and array values.\n\
It is up to the user to determine whether these options are sufficient to remove all of the sensitive \
data.
ExportHprof.skipPattern.help = A regular expression specifying which class names not to obfuscate.\n\
It is important to at least list 'java.lang.*' to avoid problems when parsing the new \
HPROF file with Memory Analyzer.
ExportHprof.avoidPattern.help = A regular expression matching names which should not be generated \
by obfuscation.
ExportHprof.mapFile.help = Specify this output file to enable obfuscation of class and field names.\n\
It is a file in properties file format generated with mappings from old class names to new obfuscated names.\n\
If present it is also read at the start to use existing mappings from previous exports of HPROF dumps.\n\
It is then updated with any new mappings.
ExportHprof.undo.help = Whether to reverse the obfuscation process using the supplied \
mapping file.
ExportHprof.objects.help = Only export selected objects. See the help for how this \
could be used to remove unreachable objects retained by the 'keep unreachable objects' option.
ExportHprof.classInst = Also export classes as object instances. Experimental, for class fields and types of classes.
