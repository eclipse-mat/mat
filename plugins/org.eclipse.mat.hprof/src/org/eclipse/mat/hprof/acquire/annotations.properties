# JMapHeapDumpProvider
JMapHeapDumpProvider.name = HPROF jmap dump provider
JMapHeapDumpProvider.help = Generates a binary HPROF heap dump using jmap.
JMapHeapDumpProvider.jdkHome.help = JDK directory\n\
This heap dump provider needs a JDK from which it can call jps and jmap. If Memory Analyzer \
is started with a JRE one may need to configure the JDK for the heap dump provider. \n\
If no JDK is specified the tool will try calling just 'jps' and 'jmap'.
JMapHeapDumpProvider.jdkList.help = Paths to possible JDK directories. Not used \
directly but can be copied and pasted into the 'jdkhome' field. \
Clear the list to refresh.
JMapHeapDumpProvider.defaultCompress.help = Whether to compress the generated dump with gzip, to save disk space at the possible cost of a longer load time.
